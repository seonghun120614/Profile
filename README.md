Lab Assignment #1 -- HTML and CSS
================================

**Project Title:** Personal Portfolio Website (3 points)

**Objective:** The goal is to create a personal portfolio website that showcases your web development skills, including HTML and CSS proficiency. This site will serve as a platform to highlight your projects, skills, and personal brand.

**Requirements:**

1.  **Home Page:** Introduce yourself with a welcoming message and share your background, education, and any relevant experience.
2.  **Portfolio Page:** Share about one or more projects in which you have participated (your past projects from other ITM courses or some personal projects) with a summary of the project and some nice images.
3.  **Skills Page:** Highlight two or three of your technical and soft skills. Use icons, progress bars or any attractive visual representation for this.
4.  **Contact Page:** Include a form with fields for name, email, and message. Since this is just a front-end project, when clicking the submit button, a message stating that the backend is under development should be shown to the user.
5.  **Navigation:** Implement a navigation bar for easy navigation across pages.
6.  **Styling:** Utilize CSS to create a cohesive look. Focus on layout, typography, and color scheme.
7.  **Responsiveness:** Ensure the website is usable on both desktop and mobile devices.

This project allows exploration of basic web development while emphasizing design and user experience principles. Explore and use the bootstrap library to enrich your personal Website (use of Sass is optional).

**Deliverables**:

1. The submission of this lab assignment is through the GitHub Classroom platform which registers the repository containing all the necessary files for your website. It is imperative that the commit history in your repository reflects consistent development progress, starting with an initial commit to establish the project baseline, followed by a series of subsequent commits that document the evolution and progression of your work. Please note that no late submissions will be accepted under any circumstances.

2. You should activate the Github Pages functionality so your website will be public (although your repository is private). 

3. The root directory of the project repository should contain a short screencast with audio (maximum 3 minutes) navigating your website, demonstrating responsiveness and showing the main elements that you used.
